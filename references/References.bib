  abstract = {Background and Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a specific instrument for measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients receiving home mechanical ventilation (HMV). Methods: The Severe Respiratory Insufficiency (SRI) Questionnaire was developed and tested for its psychometric properties following a multicentric clinical trial including 226 patients receiving HMV (mean age 57.3±14.0 years). Results: Forty-nine items passed the selection process and were allocated to seven subscales: Respiratory Complaints, Physical Functioning, Attendant Symptoms and Sleep, Social Relationships, Anxiety, Psychologic Well-Being, and Social Functioning. Cronbach's α was {\textgreater}0.7 in all subscales and {\textgreater}0.8 in four subscales indicating high internal consistency reliability. Construct validity was confirmed by factor analysis, indicating one summary scale that accounts for 59.8\% of the variance. Concurrent validity was confirmed by correlating subscales of the SRI and the SF-36 (0.21{\textless}r{\textless}0.79). Item-scale correlations revealed a high item discriminant validity. In addition, different diagnostic groups could be discriminated by the SRI. Here, the overall best HRQL was measured in the following order: patients with kyphoscoliosis, miscellaneous disorders, neuromuscular diseases, post-tuberculosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P{\textless}.05). Conclusion: The SRI is a new multidimensional instrument with high psychometric properties designed to measure specific HRQL in patients with SRI receiving HMV.},

  abstract = {There are limited data on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure during an admission requiring ventilatory support. The aim was to assess and compare the reliability and validity of the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ), Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ), Maugeri Respiratory Failure-28 (MRF-28) Questionnaire, and Severe Respiratory Insufficiency (SRI) Questionnaire in patients with very severe COPD. One hundred eighty hospitalized patients filled out the CCQ, CRQ, MRF-28, SRI, Groningen Activity Restriction Scale (GARS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (MRC). Reliability was examined by assessing distribution of total scores, floor and ceiling effects, and internal consistency (using Cronbach α coefficient). Construct validity between questionnaires and also the other measurements were tested with Spearman ρ. All four questionnaires were feasible in this setting and had reasonable characteristics for distribution of total scores, floor and ceiling effects, internal consistency, and construct validity. On balance, the SRI scored best. Additionally, the SRI had a remarkable high explained variance by HADS, GARS, and MRC (73\%). The SRI performed slightly better than the CCQ, CRQ, and MRF-28, which renders it the preferred questionnaire for scoring HRQL in patients with very severe COPD.},
